## Rick Houlihan

[Rick Houlihan](https://twitter.com/houlihan_rick) gets his own section due to his mythical status among DynamoDB fans. His AWS re:Invent talks are always the most-watched sessions on YouTube. Rick is rarely seen outside his native habitat on the strip in Las Vegas or in the AWS War Room, but some astute developers have seen him in the wild, usually mumbling about how 'all data is relational'.
